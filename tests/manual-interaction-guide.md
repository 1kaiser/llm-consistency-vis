# Neo4j Interactive Features - Manual Testing Guide

## 🎯 Test Results Summary
**✅ ALL AUTOMATED TESTS PASSED** (Server Response, Code Structure, WASM Modules)

## 🎮 Interactive Features to Test Manually

### 1. Load the Application
- Open: http://localhost:3000
- **Expected**: Page loads with radio button options

### 2. Select Neo4j Ultra Visualization
- **Action**: Click the "Neo4j Ultra-Optimized 3D Graph" radio button
- **Expected**: 
  - 3D graph canvas appears
  - Performance dashboard shows metrics
  - Zoom control buttons (🔍+, 🔍−, 🎯) appear in top-right corner

### 3. Test Zoom Controls
- **Action**: Click the 🔍+ button (zoom in)
- **Expected**: Graph zooms closer, console shows "🔍 Zoom in"
- **Action**: Click the 🔍− button (zoom out) 
- **Expected**: Graph zooms out, console shows "🔍 Zoom out"
- **Action**: Click the 🎯 button (zoom to extent)
- **Expected**: Camera resets to -1.5x zoom (z=45), console shows "🎯 Zoom to extent"

### 4. Test Mouse Interaction (Orbital Controls)
- **Action**: Click and drag on the graph canvas
- **Expected**: 
  - Graph rotates as you drag
  - Smooth rotation in X and Y axes
  - No errors in browser console

### 5. Verify Performance Metrics
- **Expected Dashboard Items**:
  - FPS: (should show frame rate)
  - Nodes: (number of word nodes)
  - Edges: (number of connections)
  - Render Time: (milliseconds)
  - Neo4j Query: (query time)
  - WASM Processing: (processing time)
  - Neo4j WASM: ✅ or ❌ (engine status)
  - Query Cache: (number of cached queries)

### 6. Test UMAP Processing Progress
- **Expected**: During initialization (first 5 seconds)
  - "UMAP Processing: ✅" appears
  - "Progress: X%" shows completion percentage
  - Progress goes from 0% to 100%

### 7. Verify Graph Properties
- **Expected**:
  - 3D spherical nodes (word bubbles)
  - Colored connections between nodes
  - Graph is centered (not off-screen)
  - Nodes stay within visible boundaries
  - Graph starts at -1.5x zoom level

### 8. Browser Console Verification
Open Developer Tools (F12) and check console for:
- **Expected Messages**:
  - "🚀 Initializing Neo4j WASM Graph Engine"
  - "🎮 Mouse controls initialized for interactive navigation"
  - "🎯 Centering graph at: (X.XX, Y.XX, Z.XX)"
  - "✅ Neo4j WASM Engine initialized successfully"
  - "🏗️ Building Neo4j word graph from X texts"

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Graph Doesn't Appear:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Neo4j radio button is selected
3. Wait 5-10 seconds for WASM initialization
4. Refresh page if needed

### If Mouse Controls Don't Work:
1. Ensure you're clicking/dragging on the dark graph canvas area
2. Check that zoom controls work (indicates Three.js is working)
3. Look for mouse event console messages

### If Performance is Poor:
1. Check FPS in performance dashboard (should be >30)
2. Reduce number of generations (Num Gen setting) if needed
3. Use Chrome/Edge for best WebGL performance

## ✅ Success Criteria

**All features working correctly if you can:**
1. ✅ Load the Neo4j 3D visualization
2. ✅ See floating zoom control buttons
3. ✅ Click zoom buttons and see graph size change
4. ✅ Drag mouse to rotate the graph
5. ✅ See performance metrics updating in real-time
6. ✅ Observe graph centering and boundaries working
7. ✅ See UMAP processing progress during initialization
8. ✅ No errors in browser console

## 🎉 Expected User Experience

The Neo4j Ultra-Optimized 3D Graph should provide:
- **Smooth 60 FPS rendering** with real-time performance metrics
- **Intuitive mouse controls** - drag to rotate, zoom controls for scaling
- **Automatic graph centering** based on word positions
- **Boundary constraints** keeping nodes within viewable area
- **Real-time WASM processing** with progress indicators
- **Professional UI** with floating controls and performance dashboard
